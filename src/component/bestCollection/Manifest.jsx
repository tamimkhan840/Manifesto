        In the era of frenzy, of the immeasurable and sterile and swirling production of spoken, typed, instant-messaged, compressed, encrypted, self-corrected and finally forgotten language,
      <strong className="block text-start">Wortees claims</strong>
      <p className="block">the concreteness of the word, of the white space, of the fiber of silence and of organic meaning.</p>
      <p><span className="font-semibold">Wortees</span> is a statement to wear, it's ink; it is an act of verbal responsibility; it is indelible polysemy of the character that we have imprinted and that we carry with us.</p>
      Wortees guards
      the potential that radiates from language, the literal definition of a struggle against the paradigm of perpetual updating, of immediate feedback, of prefabricated and suggested phrasing.
      Wortees research, Wortees is polyglot.
      Wortees respects
      the dignity of every unusual, slang, obsolete, abused, neological, archaic, neglected, overwhelmed, enchanted term.
      Wortees celebrates
      the power of enunciation, the infinite synonymy of wonder, the ambiguous lemma,
      the singular meaning, erotic lallation.
      Wortees is the hidden fullness, the unstoppable semiosis, the root nucleus, the original
      adherence to etymology and emotion.
      As if to say: meaning, beauty. Love.
